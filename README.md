# Artsy

This is a December challenge posted on twitter for everyone to get their hands on.
It is a E-commerce webapp used to sell and auction pictures/photos.

I will be using mainly React but technonlogies such as Redux toolkit will not be excluded amongst others. 

This will be a very fun challenge! I wish everyone attempting this good luck :)
